## Summary 

The streaming service Deezer heavily relies on the search to help users navigate through its extensive music catalog. Nonetheless, it is primarily designed to find specific items and does not lead directly to a smooth listening experience.

We present Text2Playlist, a stand-alone tool that addresses these limitations. Text2Playlist leverages generative AI, music information retrieval and recommendation systems to generate query-specific and personalized playlists, successfully deployed at scale.
